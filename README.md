There are four Grandslams that are held each year, In the data we have 3 instances of the Australian open but 2 <em>Australian open(Jan)</em> and <em> Australian open Dec </em> are all Australian open its just there are few instances in the data where we have Australian open with Jan and Dec as part of the string

In terms who reins supreme the data is quite clear of who heads the chart, the date is upto early months of 2023 meaning we are missing out on the other grandslams held in the later parts of the year, but all the same the data should be able to help understand how the players have faired.

Without a doubt there is a reason why Rafael Nadal is known as the king of clay, at the Stade Roland Garros in Paris, Nadal has 14 titles to his name, this was his competition as even Roger won the title just once while Novak has 2 titles to his name based on the data, though on browsing it can be noted that Novak captured his 3rd title in 2023.
